  <p class="main-lede">Welcome to Friend's Dinner! We're a small group of friends in Boston that gets together once a week to cook and share a homemade meal, have a few drinks, and have a good fucking time doing so. This here is a collection of the recipes that we've made thus far. Having rigorously tested each one, we can guarantee that they're all pretty damn tasty. ;-)</p>
